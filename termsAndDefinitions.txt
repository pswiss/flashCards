action|Preemptable (interruptable) services. If you have a service that takes a long time (moving a robot arm), you can use an ____ to make them interruptable.
bag|A ____ is a file that contains recorded topic data. The associated package that defines command line tools and APIs for interacting with ____.
callback|A ____ is a function that gets "connected" to a particular event. The most common usage would be a function inside of a node that gets called every time a message gets published on a particular topic.
catkin|This is the primary build system of ROS. ____ is used to convert message definitions into useful code, C++ code into executables, define installation instructions for packages, and other things. More about these ideas can be read on the ____ conceptual overview page.
catkin_create_pkg|[command] Automatically create a new directory with a template CMakeLists.txt and package.xml â€“ the two files required by all ROS packages. Allows you to list dependencies and have them automatically be filled out in the package.xml.
catkin_init_workspace|[command] Creates a symlink from your workspace src directory to a CMake file located in your current ROS install. This is a required step for catkin to function properly.
catkin_lint|[command] This is a relatively new package designed for finding issues with catkin package.xml and CMakeLists.txt files.
catkin_make|[command] Builds targets contained in a workspace. Must be executed from the root of the workspace.
catkinize|[command] This command calls several scripts that are designed to help the transition from rosbuild to catkin.
client library|these are the "glue" that tie ROS concepts together with code that you write. For example, rospy is the ____ that allows a user to write Python code that interacts with the ROS world via publishing, subscribing, parameters, etc. There are several different ____, but the most commonly used are roscpp and rospy; rosjava and roslisp are both used occasionally.
CMakeLists.txt|This file tells catkin how and what to build in a particular package.
environment variable|ROS uses a variety of ____s to define where packages are located, which ROS version you are using, where to look for the ROS master, to identify your machine, and more. These are typically set via setup.bash files in your workspace.
latch|When a publisher is created, if it is set to ____, then every time a new subscriber to that publisher's topic is created, it will automatically receive a copy of the last message that was published on that topic. This can be useful for topics that are only published occasionally (like map data or status indicators).
launch|A ____ file along with the command line tool roslaunch allow you to do many ROS operations with a single command. You can set parameters, run nodes, include other ____ files, parse command line arguments, and more.
logging|ROS has a special mechanism for storing, sorting, filtering, etc. messages that are printed to the terminal from running nodes. This is done via the rosout topic and with ROS____instead of standard print statements. ____ files can be sorted and searched in real-time via rqt_console, and they can be parsed/searched manually by looking in the '~/.ros/log/' directory.
manifest|A ____ is an XML file that must be included in the root directory of any ROS package. The file declares the package name, dependencies, version number, author, and more. In rosbuild, the old ROS build system, this file was named ____.xml; In catkin, the new build system, the file is named package.xml.
master|The ____ is a ROS process that helps nodes locate each other and establish communication channels based on their publisher/ subscriber relationships and any services. The ____ also manages the parameter server. The ____ is typically started through the roscore command-line tool, or it is automatically started via a roslaunch call.
MD5|Messages are serialized to facilitate communicating their data structures between nodes that may be in different languages: _______. For this to work, both nodes must know how and what data was serialized. ROS uses an ____ hash calculation for verifying this information. This is one of the primary issues in interoperability between different versions of ROS i.e. different versions may have different message definitions, resulting in different ____ hashes.
message|A .[omitted] file defines the contents of a ROS ____ using a simple text description format. A ____ is a data structure that is communicated over a ROS topic. During a catkin_make invocation, these .[omitted] files are used to generate language-specific implementations of these data structures for use in the client libraries e.g. a simple ____ definition automatically gets converted into both a Python class that can be used with import, and a C++ header that can be used with #include.
metapackage|A ____ is a way of building a collection of ROS packages. The ____ does not install files, contain any code, or any other common package files. Rather, it simply lists dependencies on a group of other packages. If one installs the ____, they typically automatically install all its dependencies (usually via apt-get). A ____ is the catkin replacement for the rosbuild concept of a stack. Often ____ are still referred to as stacks e.g. "the navigation stack".
name|All elements in the ROS computation graph (nodes, services, topics, parameters, etc.) must have a valid graph resource ____. The master uses these ____s when forming connections, and they are an important part of how simple systems can scale up to complex systems through encapsulation.
node|A ____ is simply a process that, when run, performs some sort of computation in the ROS world. ____ communicate with each other via topics, services, and parameters.
package|ROS software is organized into ____s. A ____ may include nodes, configuration files, non-ROS libraries, launch files, and more. All ____ must have a ____.xml file defining its manifest.
parameter|A globally accessible variable (all nodes can see them). Typically these contain things like configuration or calibration data. They are set and retrieved via the ____ server run by the master.
publisher|Nodes use ____ to send data, or "____" data, on a particular topic.
remap|Many ROS names such as topics, services, and parameters can be "____ed" at the command line. This allows multiple nodes of the same type to be started with different configurations. It also facilitates re-use of general nodes in specific cases.
rosbag|[command] This is a command line tool for creating, analyzing, playing, etc., bag files
rosbuild|[command] Up until the Fuerte version of ROS this package provided a set of CMake macros for compiling ROS packages. This has largely been replaced by catkin.

tf|This is a special package and topic for tracking transformations between coordinate frames. Many robotic systems rely heavily on geometric calculations and ____ is the primary way to do these calculations within ROS.
time|ROS has built-in primitives for defining the current ROS ____. Often messages are timestamped, and this can be an important way of "synchronizing" portions of your system.
timer|A ____ is used to get callbacks to run at a specified frequency. This is useful for polling things like keyboard input, publishing "heartbeat" messages, and many other things.
topic|A ____ is a named channel over which nodes communicate messages. ____s facilitate a one-to-many or many-to-many communication paradigm i.e. one subscriber publishing a message on a ____ can have many subscribers listening to that ____.
